### Product

SaVaGe Artwork Creator is an app that allows the user to create SVGs using different shapes. Once the SVG is created, the user can copy the code to add to his/her html file. 

### User Journey 
1.) User logs in with username & password
2.) Once logged in, user can create SVGs and create shapes
3.) To create the artwork, the user can select any shape (created by any user) and add it to his/her svgs (only the svgs that he/she created) 

All artwork (created by any user) is visible in the gallery. The gallery is alway visible, no matter if the user is logged in or not.
